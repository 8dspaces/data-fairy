========================

Different configurations for the template writer are stored in an XML file, usually named TemplateConfig_LANGUAGE.xml.
To generate code, load up a template config, and apply it to a Datasource. The Template Writer DLL can be included into any project and used to generate code for this purpose.

The Template Config file contains references to code template files used to create the dataset.

========================
Recognised templates:

Database File Template - The index of all classes generated by the routine
Class File Template - The structure for an individual class, containing all data
Enumeration File Template - The structure for an enumeration containing all IDs
Package File - Any number of additional files that need to live in the same package as the Database, Classes, and Enumerations, such as interface or utility classes.

========================
Fragments:

Fragments are short, one line templates that the code generator will produce when iterating over a series of rows or tables.
The required fragements are:

StaticVariable - A class level static variable template
NewClassInstance - A single line constructor for instantiating a new class
VariableAssignment - The format for assigning one variable to another

========================
Config Variables

Name - A short descriptive name for the template
Author - The person or company who wrote the template
Contact - Useful contact information for the author

DataBaseFileTemplate - The relative path of the Database File Template file
ClassFileTemplate - The relative path of the Class File Template file
EnumerationFileTemplate - The relative path of the Enumeration File Template file
PackageFile - The relative path of a Package File template

PackageSeperator - The symbol, or symbols used to seperate package groups (aka namespaces). E.g. a . (net.mkv25.DataFairy), or a / (net/mkv25/DataFairy).
CreatePackageFolderStructure - true | false - should the package string be used to create folders.

Variable - Any number of Key->Value pair variables that will be searched and replaced for in ALL template files.

========================
Search and Repalce Template Strings

DATABASE_TABLES - A list of all database tables, used in Database File Template.
CLASS_NAME - Used in the Class File Template, Enumeration File Template, and New Class Instance fragment.
NAME - Used for variable creation in New Class Instance fragment, and Static Variable fragment.
TYPE - Used for variable creation in New Class Instance fragment, and Static Variable fragment.
PARAMS - Used to assign parameters to the constructor of a new object, in New Class Instance fragment.
NAME1 - Used to identify a local, or class level variable in Variable Assignment fragment.
NAME2 - Used to identify a local, or class level variable in Variable Assignment fragment.
